## Liskov Substitution principle

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

The Goal of this principle is to basically prevent our old codebase from breaking due to new code.

#### Benefits:

1) By implementing the LSP, we are keeping our functionality intact and still having our subclasses act as a substitute to a base class.
2) Also, we encourage the code reusability by implementing the LCP and having better project maintenance as well.
