## Interface segregation principle

No code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

The goal of this principle is to reduce the side effects of using larger interfaces by breaking application interfaces into smaller ones.

#### Benefits:

1) Reducing our class implementation only to required actions without any additional or unnecessary code.
2) Increases the readability and maintainability of code.
